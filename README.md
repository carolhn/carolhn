  about: `
      Full Stack Developer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), contributing to a global project for Johnson & Johnson.

      Over the past 4 years, I have been building scalable and high-performance web applications using React.js, Node.js,
      TypeScript, and JavaScript. My work focuses on clean architecture, maintainable code, performance optimization
      and user-centered solutions.

      I actively contribute to software quality through unit testing (Jest), monitoring and observability
      (Apigee, Google Analytics), and technical documentation (Confluence). Experienced in Agile 
      methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, collaborating with cross-functional global teams.

      Passionate about continuous learning and technical growth.
